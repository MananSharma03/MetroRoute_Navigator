The Metro Navigation System is a web-based application designed to help users navigate the metro system efficiently. It allows users to select from various options such as finding the shortest distance or time between two stations, determining the shortest path based on distance or time, and calculating fares based on these criteria. The user interface includes dropdown menus for selecting source and destination stations, and it provides a visual representation of the metro map for easy reference. The application leverages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a smooth and interactive user experience, ensuring that commuters can plan their journeys with ease and accuracy.

The main concepts involved in the Metro Navigation System project include:

**Graph Theory**: The metro stations and routes are represented as a graph, where stations are nodes and routes are edges with weights representing distances or times.

Shortest Path Algorithms: Algorithms like Dijkstra's or A* are used to compute the shortest path between two stations based on distance or time.

HTML/CSS/JavaScript: The front-end of the application is built using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity and logic implementation.

DOM Manipulation: JavaScript is used to dynamically update the HTML content based on user interactions, such as selecting source and destination stations.

Visualization: A visual representation of the metro map helps users to understand the routes and plan their journeys more effectively.
